# Animated Galaxy in Three.js and Shaders

Welcome to the Animated Galaxy project! This repository showcases an interactive 3D galaxy simulation using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and custom shaders. Dive into the code to explore how to create mesmerizing galaxy animations with advanced graphics techniques.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create an animated galaxy using Three.js, a popular JavaScript library for 3D graphics, and GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) shaders. The galaxy is composed of thousands of stars and nebulae, with dynamic animations driven by custom vertex and fragment shaders.

## Features

- **Dynamic Galaxy Simulation:** Visualize a galaxy with swirling stars and nebulae.
- **Custom Shaders:** Utilize GLSL shaders for advanced visual effects.
- **Interactive Controls:** Use your mouse or keyboard to explore the galaxy.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/animated-galaxy.git
    cd animated-galaxy
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

1. **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

2. **Open your browser:**

    Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the animated galaxy.

## How It Works

- **Three.js Setup:** The project uses Three.js to handle 3D rendering and scene management.
- **Shaders:** Custom vertex and fragment shaders are used to create the galaxy's visual effects. You can find the shader code in the `src/shaders` directory.
- **Animation Loop:** The galaxy is animated using Three.js's render loop, with real-time updates driven by shader calculations.

## Customizing

You can modify the galaxy appearance and behavior by adjusting the following:

- **Shader Parameters:** Tweak the GLSL shader code in `src/shaders/`.
- **Galaxy Settings:** Modify the `src/galaxy.js` file to change star density, colors, or other properties.
